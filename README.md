Bifurcation Analysis of Coupled Homogeneous Heterogeneous reactions in Monolith Reactors

This package can be used to calculate steady state bifurcation diagrams for Short Monolith Model (Two-phased CSTR) for any
type of reaction system. The reaction network and the global reaction kinetics are to be added as .txt files. And then the
name of the reaction .txt file is to be added to the 'script_bif_dia.py' file to run the bifurcation codes.
